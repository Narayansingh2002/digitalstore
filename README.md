This is an enhanced version of the GamerCheck project, with this project i developed my frontend skills with the use of hover effects, transforms and transitions to make the website more visually appealing, as well as a bit of JavaScript for interactivity. Moreover, after completing this website i'am much more comfortable with using media queries for responsive design.
